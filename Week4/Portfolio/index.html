        <h1>Lara Andrade</h1>
        <p><strong>Hi, my name is Lara Andrade.</strong>
            I am a Computer Programming student at Humber College. I have over 10 years
        of experience as a Graphic Designer, specializing in developing graphic projects
        and advertising materials, and working as a social media professional.
        I have a background in digital marketing focused on web design, and I'm eager to
        expand my knowledge and pursue a career as a UX/UI designer.
        I'm passionate about design, photography, video production and beers! ;)</p>
